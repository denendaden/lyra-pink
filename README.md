# lyra.pink -- lyra's personal website

This is the repository for my personal website, <https://lyra.pink>, written using Flask and Jinja templates.
It was previously written in Rust using the Actix Web framework (see <a href="https://github.com/Denendaden/lyra-pink-rust">here</a>), but that codebase became increasingly unmaintainable.
